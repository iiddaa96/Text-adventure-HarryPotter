## Hogwarts Adventures by Ida Casperson

**Description**
In this submission, I have created an interactive experience where the user can make changes to a world. Examples of such changes are: going to another room, picking up objects, talking to entities, etc. The task is free and you choose for yourself what your world should look like and how the user interacts in the world. Let your creativity flow!

My text adventure is called Hogwarts Adventure, where you navigate through buttons that I have created in js.
The idea is that you should save Ron from Voldemort in a short and simple way, he has been kidnapped and you are the savior in need. To do this you have to pass through different rooms to get there through buttons. On the way you need to pick up two tools to then be able to save Ron.

I use a lot of javascript. Arrays, create several buttons and a list of images that will be used during the game. Backpack where you as the player should bring two things with you to complete the "adventure".
